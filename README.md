Simple Woodcutting Account Building
If anyone wants some ideas at code or wants a WC account building script here's my first implementation. Feel free to use it for ideas or botting, I would change some factors or variables to make it more your own.
```
Features: (TREES are PINK, BANKS are YELLOW)
  Can Power-Chop
  Can use Dragon-Axe Special
  Can take randomized breaks: 
     These are rolled every 15 seconds and increase by 1% every minute. The longer botting time, the
    higher chance of a break, and increased length.
  Can Bank:
      Only where bank and trees are in screen view. (Draynor, Seers Village, Woodcutting Guild).
  Decently Robust, but you can still find lots of bugs.  
  
  ASSUMES: 
    Axe is in inventory or equipped
    Trees are PINK
    Bank is Yellow
    Banks is set to "Deposit All"
  
```
